# Zscaler recipes

Original recipes forked from [rtrouton-recipes](https://github.com/autopkg/rtrouton-recipes/tree/master/Zscaler).

Change the `DESIRED_VERSION` input variable to match the version to download. As long as Zscaler doesn't change the Cloudfront CDN URL this should continue to work. Please open a PR or file an issue if/when it doesn't.
